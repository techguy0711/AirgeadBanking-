Computer Science Portfolio

* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
     * This is a banking app to manage investments. 
* What did you do particularly well?
     * I enjoy writing the math code. C++ has some really nice built in tools.
* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
     * I would rewrite the UI from being CLI to QT library to add some pop to the UI.
* Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
     * I prefer to code in VSCode because I use MinGW compiler with some extensions that provide detailed compiler errors which make coding more efficient. Thus when I needed help the compiler gave me the information needed. For example.
* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    * Working with string, and number formatting. 
* How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    * I like to use as many functions as possible. This makes the code more maintainable, and scalable.
